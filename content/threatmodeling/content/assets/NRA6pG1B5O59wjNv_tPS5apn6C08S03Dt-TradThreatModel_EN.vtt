00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.528
To begin a threat modeling exercise,

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.704
gather the stakeholders in the same room.

00:00:05.216 --> 00:00:07.628
You would need a security expert and the product owner.

00:00:07.984 --> 00:00:11.072
And depending on how comprehensive you want the exercise to be, 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.816
you might need the software architect, business analyst,

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.352
and the delivery manager too.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.360
Throw in Bob from the risk management team as well.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:23.328
These people will bring different perspectives and ideas to the table,

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:26.751
and also build a shared understanding of what's important.

00:00:27.064 --> 00:00:29.240
Next up, bring in the diagrams.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.140
Lots of it. Well, it depends again on how

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.160
comprehensive you want things to be.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.000
You'll need the technical diagrams of the different components of your application.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.160
Don't forget the data flow diagrams.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.060
This will help assess where attackers can inject threats.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.040
Mull over those diagrams for a bit.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.030
Once everyone is familiar with the diagrams, it's time to brainstorm for threats.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.030
Take your favorite methodology

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.190
then follow the data flow lines to come up with threats.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.050
Identify all the threats that you can see,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.070
both broad and technical.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.010
Write them on stickies and post it on a board where your diagrams are. 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.220
This is the fun part but will also take awhile.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.240
Once all the threats are in, you need to define the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.060
impact and probability for each.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.220
What's the impact of that threat to your customers? To the business?

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.290
What are the riskiest threats that you should prioritize?

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.080
Rank risks based on your risk approach.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.120
For each prioritized threat, 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.140
define security controls to mitigate the risk.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.010
These controls are actionable items that your team can perform and validate.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.100
The output of a threat modeling exercise is the list of threats and their controls.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.140
Don't throw those stickies yet. 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.010
Log them in a place where your developers can refer back to

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.190
and for the stakeholders to check the status of.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.080
Excel? JIRA? Whatever works for your team.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.000
This exercise should give you a great start in building a secure product.
